# Episterizo — Next.js starter

This workspace contains a minimal Next.js project scaffold for a modern, responsive Christian Q&A site based on Episterizo.

Folders created:
- `components/` — React components (Layout, etc.)
- `data/` — JSON data for chapters/questions
- `pages/` — Next.js pages (Home, Chapters, GeneralQuestions, Resources)
- `styles/` — global CSS and Tailwind setup

Next steps:
1. From the project root, run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. To finish Tailwind setup, run `npx tailwindcss init -p` or use the provided `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.

Notes:
- This is only the file/folder scaffold and placeholder pages. You need to install dependencies and optionally tweak Tailwind versions.
