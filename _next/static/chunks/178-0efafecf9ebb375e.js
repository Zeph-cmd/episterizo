Without resurrection, faith is empty and salvation incomplete.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"},{q:"Is every redeemed person automatically born again?",a:"Redemption is the first step toward salvation, not the full experience. One can be redeemed yet not born again until he believes in the resurrection and confesses Jesus as Lord.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"},{q:"What does it truly mean to be born again?",a:"To be born again is to share in the resurrection life of Christ. It means being raised with Him and becoming a participant in the divine nature — not merely forgiven, but re-gened with God’s life.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"},{q:"Why is believing in the resurrection essential to salvation?",a:"Romans 10 : 9 declares that salvation comes by confessing Jesus as Lord and believing God raised Him from the dead. Resurrection is the proof of divine sonship and the source of our new life.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"},{q:"Can someone be a churchgoer and still not be born again?",a:"Yes. Church attendance or moral reform doesn’t equal new birth. Only the joint-resurrection experience with Christ makes one a new creation seated with Him in heavenly places.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"},{q:"Why shouldn’t believers focus only on the cross?",a:"The cross was the means to an end — death to redeem. The resurrection is the end — life to reign.

Divine participation reveals identification — man died and rose with Christ. The believer’s salvation isn’t a swap but a shared life.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"},{q:"Did Jesus die for us or with us?",a:"He died both for us and with us. His death was representative, yet inclusive — our old man was crucified with Him so that we could share His new life.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"},{q:"Why is substitution not the full picture of salvation?",a:"Substitution only handles punishment; participation produces transformation. The cross removed sin’s penalty, but participation in Christ’s resurrection made us new creations.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"},{q:"How does divine participation affect the believer’s nature?",a:"Through participation, the believer becomes one spirit with the Lord. Salvation is not God tolerating a sinner — it’s God reproducing Himself in man.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"},{q:"Is salvation just forgiveness of sins?",a:"Forgiveness clears the record; salvation recreates the man. The goal of the cross was not pardon but regeneration — bringing man into the God-kind of life.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"},{q:"What happens if one believes only in the substitution aspect?",a:"He may live forgiven but powerless.

The second is sin not unto death—acts committed by ignorance or weakness. The former is removed by Christ’s sacrifice; the latter by continual fellowship.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 3"},{q:"What is meant by 'sin unto death'?",a:"It refers to Adam’s sin that brought spiritual death on all mankind. Only Jesus’ death and resurrection dealt with it once and for all.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 3"},{q:"Can a believer commit the sin unto death?",a:"No. The believer is no longer in Adam but in Christ. He has passed from death to life; sin unto death cannot be imputed to him.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 3"},{q:"What happens when a believer sins after salvation?",a:"He doesn’t lose salvation but breaks fellowship. The remedy is confession of faith, not begging for forgiveness, since sin was already judged in Christ.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 3"},{q:"Why do some still confess sins daily?",a:"Because they mistake relationship for fellowship. Salvation is permanent; fellowship is maintained by acknowledging truth, not repeated guilt.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 3"},{q:"What are the two types of confession?",a:"The sinner confesses Jesus as Lord for salvation. The saint confesses his faith in what Christ has done, not his faults for forgiveness.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 3"},{q:"What does 1 John 1:9 really mean for believers?",a:"It’s not a sinner’s repentance verse but a restoration verse for fellowship. Confession here means agreeing with God’s truth, not re-crucifying Jesus.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 3"},{q:"Can confession cleanse sin?",a:"Confession doesn’t cleanse; the blood already has. Confession aligns the believer with the cleansing that’s already a finished work.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 3"},{q:"What does it mean that there are two deaths?",a:"The first death is spiritual separation from God; the second is physical death. Jesus died both spiritually and physically to conquer both for us.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 3"},{q:"Why must believers understand these two confessions?",a:"Because wrong confession produces fear and guilt.

Every believer is born into this victory, not struggling to attain it.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 4"},{q:"What is the 'pattern' of the Overcomer?",a:"Jesus is the divine pattern. The believer mirrors His life—living from victory, not toward it. Our pattern is resurrection life expressed through faith and obedience.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 4"},{q:"What does it mean to live the life of Zion?",a:"The life of Zion is living from the heavenly realm where Christ dwells. It’s a life above limitation, corruption, and defeat, manifesting divine dominion on earth.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 4"},{q:"Is victory automatic for every believer?",a:"Victory is a gift by nature, but experience by knowledge. Every believer has it in spirit, but it’s manifested through revelation and faith walk.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 4"},{q:"What separates an Overcomer from an ordinary believer?",a:"Revelation. The Overcomer knows who he is in Christ and acts accordingly. Ignorance produces struggle; revelation produces triumph.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 4"},{q:"What is meant by 'life in Zion' being incorruptible?",a:"It means the believer’s life in Christ cannot decay or diminish. Zion life is divine life—ever fresh, ever victorious, immune to death and sin.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 4"},{q:"How does the believer enforce victory daily?",a:"By confession of faith and meditation on the Word. Victory is maintained by alignment with truth, not by fighting the devil or circumstances.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 4"},{q:"What is the believer’s warfare in the life of Zion?",a:"It’s not carnal battle but faith rest. The warfare is maintaining truth and resisting deception, for Christ already conquered every enemy.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 4"},{q:"What does it mean to reign in life with Christ?",a:"It means exercising dominion over sin, sickness, and death through righteousness. Reigning is not future—it’s a present reality of the new creation.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 4"},{q:"Why is understanding Zion essential for spiritual growth?",a:"Because Zion defines the believer’s origin and realm. Until one knows he’s from Zion, he’ll live as though from the earth.

They are mutually exclusive patterns of life.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 5"},{q:"What empowers the believer’s walk?",a:"Grace. The same power that raised Christ enables daily living. The Spirit energizes the believer’s will and emotions to manifest divine conduct.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 5"},{q:"Why are there many Greek words for 'walk'?",a:"Because walking in Christ is multidimensional—character, doctrine, fellowship, and mission. Each term highlights a unique expression of divine life.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 5"},{q:"How does right walking glorify God?",a:"When believers express Christ’s nature visibly, the world sees the invisible God.

It’s the believer’s proof of being born of the Spirit.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 6"},{q:"How do tongues edify the believer?",a:"Tongues build up the inner man. When you speak mysteries to God, your spirit is charged, strengthened, and aligned with divine will.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 6"},{q:"Why does Paul say tongues are mysteries?",a:"Because they bypass human reasoning. In tongues, the spirit prays secrets—divine codes of destiny and revelation that the mind cannot conceive.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 6"},{q:"Do I need interpretation when I pray in tongues privately?",a:"No. Private prayer in tongues is communication with God. Interpretation applies mainly in public ministry for the edification of others.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 6"},{q:"Can speaking in tongues be learned or faked?",a:"No one learns real tongues; it is imparted by the Spirit. Counterfeits exist, but genuine tongues carry peace, power, and presence that cannot be mimicked.",link:"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 6"},{q:"What happens spiritually when I pray long in tongues?",a:"Your spirit gains ascendancy over the flesh.
