{"pageProps":{"chapter":{"id":2,"slug":"salvation-divine-exchange-or-participation","chapter":"Salvation — Divine Exchange or Divine Participation?","tagline":"Revealing that Jesus didn’t substitute man’s place but included man in His death and resurrection.","questions":[{"q":"What is the difference between divine exchange and divine participation?","a":"Divine exchange teaches substitution — Jesus took man’s place. Divine participation reveals identification — man died and rose with Christ. The believer’s salvation isn’t a swap but a shared life.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"},{"q":"Did Jesus die for us or with us?","a":"He died both for us and with us. His death was representative, yet inclusive — our old man was crucified with Him so that we could share His new life.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"},{"q":"Why is substitution not the full picture of salvation?","a":"Substitution only handles punishment; participation produces transformation. The cross removed sin’s penalty, but participation in Christ’s resurrection made us new creations.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"},{"q":"How does divine participation affect the believer’s nature?","a":"Through participation, the believer becomes one spirit with the Lord. Salvation is not God tolerating a sinner — it’s God reproducing Himself in man.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"},{"q":"Is salvation just forgiveness of sins?","a":"Forgiveness clears the record; salvation recreates the man. The goal of the cross was not pardon but regeneration — bringing man into the God-kind of life.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"},{"q":"What happens if one believes only in the substitution aspect?","a":"He may live forgiven but powerless. Full salvation experience begins when one believes he died and rose *with* Christ — sharing in His righteousness and dominion.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 2"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
