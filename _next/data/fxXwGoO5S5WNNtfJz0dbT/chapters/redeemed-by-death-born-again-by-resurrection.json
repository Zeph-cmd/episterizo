{"pageProps":{"chapter":{"id":1,"slug":"redeemed-by-death-born-again-by-resurrection","chapter":"Redeemed by Death, Born Again by Resurrection","tagline":"Understanding that redemption and new birth are not the same reality.","questions":[{"q":"Does Jesus’ death alone make us born again?","a":"No. The death of Jesus redeems us and brings forgiveness of sins, but it is His resurrection that births us into new life. Without resurrection, faith is empty and salvation incomplete.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"},{"q":"Is every redeemed person automatically born again?","a":"Redemption is the first step toward salvation, not the full experience. One can be redeemed yet not born again until he believes in the resurrection and confesses Jesus as Lord.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"},{"q":"What does it truly mean to be born again?","a":"To be born again is to share in the resurrection life of Christ. It means being raised with Him and becoming a participant in the divine nature — not merely forgiven, but re-gened with God’s life.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"},{"q":"Why is believing in the resurrection essential to salvation?","a":"Romans 10 : 9 declares that salvation comes by confessing Jesus as Lord and believing God raised Him from the dead. Resurrection is the proof of divine sonship and the source of our new life.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"},{"q":"Can someone be a churchgoer and still not be born again?","a":"Yes. Church attendance or moral reform doesn’t equal new birth. Only the joint-resurrection experience with Christ makes one a new creation seated with Him in heavenly places.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"},{"q":"Why shouldn’t believers focus only on the cross?","a":"The cross was the means to an end — death to redeem. The resurrection is the end — life to reign. The believer lives beyond the cross in the power and riches of resurrection life.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 1"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
