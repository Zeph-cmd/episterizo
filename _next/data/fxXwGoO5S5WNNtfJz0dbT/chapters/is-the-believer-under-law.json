{"pageProps":{"chapter":{"id":8,"slug":"is-the-believer-under-law","chapter":"Is the Believer Under Law?","tagline":"Explaining the believer’s freedom from the Mosaic law and life in the higher law of the Spirit.","questions":[{"q":"Is the believer still under the Ten Commandments?","a":"No. The believer is under the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, not the Mosaic code. The moral intent is fulfilled in love through the Spirit, not rule-keeping.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 8"},{"q":"Did Jesus come to abolish the law?","a":"He came to fulfill it, not abolish it. By fulfilling it, He rendered it complete so believers now live by His finished work, not the old system.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 8"},{"q":"What is the difference between law and grace?","a":"Law demands; grace supplies. Law says 'do and live'; grace says 'live and therefore do.' Grace empowers what law only commands.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 8"},{"q":"Does grace give license to sin?","a":"Never. Grace empowers righteousness. True understanding of grace produces holiness, not compromise.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 8"},{"q":"Why couldn’t the law make man righteous?","a":"Because it addressed actions, not nature. Only Christ’s life within could change the heart and produce true righteousness.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 8"},{"q":"What replaced the old law for believers?","a":"The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus—an inward principle where the Spirit guides and empowers obedience from within.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 8"},{"q":"What does Paul mean by 'we are not under law but under grace'?","a":"He means believers no longer relate to God through legal demands but through favor and life in the Spirit. Grace is the new governing system.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 8"},{"q":"Why was the law called a schoolmaster?","a":"Because it tutored man until Christ came. Once faith arrived, the believer graduated from external regulations to internal guidance.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 8"},{"q":"How should believers view the Old Testament law today?","a":"As shadow and instruction pointing to Christ. It reveals principles but not requirements for the new-creation life.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 8"},{"q":"What proves a believer lives above the law?","a":"When love rules his heart. Love is the fulfillment of the law, and the Spirit sheds that love abroad within every born-again believer.","link":"Read: Episterizo, Chapter 8"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
